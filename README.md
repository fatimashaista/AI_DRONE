# AI_DRONE

This project assesses the feasibility of a model by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial surveillances. The purpose of aerial surveillance is using sensors to cover the task
area to obtain the information regarding the area. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are helpful in handling the Covid-19 pandemic for ensuring public safety. The first part of the proposed model uses AI to collect data through
drones - analyse and provide necessary steps for detecting if an individual is wearing a mask or not. The second part is social distancing analysis through a live video stream; the video is
captured through the drone. The analytics and statistics generated through the model is stored in the control room which is helpful for proper analysis in the highly congested areas or places
where the chances of covid-19 spreading is high. Face recognition work with the label names under progress.
